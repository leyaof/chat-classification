# chat-classification

The html version of the project can be found [here](https://leyaof.github.io/Notebooks/chat-classification-analysis.html)
#### Introduction
In this analysis, I will perform text classification on the in-game chat data in Dota 2 matches. Because of the competitive nature of this team based game, I suspect that the in-game chat history will contain a lot of toxic/salty comments depending if the players are winning or lossing. A breif introduction as well as an exploratory data analysis of game matches can be found [here](https://leyaof.github.io/Notebooks/dota%20analysis.nb.html).

#### Dataset
All data used in this analysis are collected from the open source platform, [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com/). The dataset contains 6810 chat messages from across different game matches.
